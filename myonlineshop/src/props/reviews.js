      "Great headphones overall. The sound quality is excellent and they're very comfortable to wear for long periods. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the app could use some improvements.",

      "I've tried many wireless headphones over the years, and these are by far the best. The battery life is impressive - I only need to charge them about once a week with daily use. The noise cancellation is perfect for my commute.",

      "Decent headphones, but I expected more for the price. The sound quality is good, but I've had some issues with Bluetooth connectivity. Customer service was helpful when I reached out about the problem.",
