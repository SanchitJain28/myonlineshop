            <p>
              Our return/refund/replacement policy only applies if the products are damaged or wrong products are
              delivered. The policy lasts 7 days. If 7 days have passed since delivery, we can't offer you any refund or
              exchange.
            </p>
            <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused.</p>
            <p>
              Apart from the above-mentioned issues, refund/reshipment/replacement will also be granted if products are
              missing in the order or wrong products are delivered. (If possible, please send us the unpacking video too;
              it will help us investigate better).
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not have an automatic refund system. Customers have to message us on Instagram/WhatsApp for refund if
              their prepaid orders are returned to the origin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our courier service will pick up the item to be returned from the customer's doorstep. We ourselves will pay
              the shipping costs for returning/replacing the item. The customer does not need to bother about anything.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cases when a shipment is undelivered/returned to us due to some reasons from the courier's side, the
              customer will receive a full refund.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on where you live, the time it may take for your exchanged product to reach you may vary.</p>
